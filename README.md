#  Shopping Cart  

- A simple shopping cart application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
 Originally based on [mihailgaberov/shopping-cart-app](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/shopping-cart-app),
 then extended with new features, pages, and design improvements.  
- [![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-brightgreen)](https://shopping-cart-nu-murex.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- Browse products and add them to the cart  
- Manage cart (increase/decrease quantity, remove items)  
- Calculate total price  
- Persistent state (cart stored in localStorage)

### ✅ My Additions
- **Wishlist Page** – save and manage favorite products separately from the cart  
- **Product Filters** – filter products by category for easier browsing  
- **Product Details Page** – view more information about each product (description, images, price, details, reviews, QR code etc.)
- **Product Price** – Display discounted price of the product and discount precentage
- **Style Adjustments** – improved layout, design, and UI consistency, and mobile responsiveness beyond the original tutorial  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (with Hooks)  
- TypeScript
- SCSS Modules for styling  

## 🌐 API

This project uses the [[DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products)]  (https://dummyjson.com/products) to fetch products data, including categories, descriptions, images, and pricing.
